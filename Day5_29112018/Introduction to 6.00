What is a 'type'?
Types are classifications of objects, which is what Python, as an OOP language,
deals with. They determine how those objects are dealt with (for example, adding
two integers results in an integer, two strings results in a concatenated
string, and an integer and a string results in an error).

What is an 'expression'?
An expression is composed of objects (or operands) and operators, and can be
interpreted into a value.

What is a type conversion?
A type conversion turns one type of object into another. For example, applying
str to the integer 3 results in the string '3'.

What is a keyword?
Keywords are words that have special meanings within a language. Many editors
will display them in special colors. These words cannot be used as variables.

What is the difference between a straight line program and a branching program?
A straight line program simply goes through and carries out each step. A
branching program will do different things depending on conditions set within
the program.

What is a conditional?
A conditional statement starts with an if statement, and can also include elif
and else statements.
